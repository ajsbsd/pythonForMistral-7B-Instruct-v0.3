pythonForMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3
A Python-based interface for interacting with the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 language model.

Overview
This project provides a simple Python script to interact with the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 model. It allows users to input prompts and receive generated responses, which are then logged for future reference or fine-tuning purposes.

Features
Interactive Prompting: Input prompts directly via the command line.

Response Generation: Utilize the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 model to generate responses.

Logging: Automatically logs each prompt and its corresponding response with a timestamp to a CSV file.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher

Required Python packages:

mistral_inference

mistral_common

Ensure that the Mistral model and tokenizer files are available locally.
